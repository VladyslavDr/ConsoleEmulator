# ConsoleEmulator

ConsoleEmulator is a console program that emulates the command line for managing files and directories in your operating system. The program provides users with the ability to perform various file operations, such as viewing a list of files and folders, creating, deleting, renaming files and directories, and navigating between directories. It is implemented in the C# programming language and uses standard .NET Framework tools to work with the file system.

## The main functions I plan to implement

- Displaying a list of files and folders in the current working directory.
- Moving between directories.
- Create new directories.
- Deleting files and folders.
- Copy files and folders.
- Rename files and folders.
- Display the contents of files.
- Search for files and folders in the current working directory and its subdirectories.
- And much more.

## Usage

I will provide a description later
